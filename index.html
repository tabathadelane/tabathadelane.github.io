        <div id="about">
          <p>
          I'm making a career change to tech after 10 years of experience in Food Service and Management. </p>
        </div>
        <div id="qs">
          <div id="Q1">Why Food Service?</div>
          <div id="A1">Life happened. I was too young to commit to an idea in college and as life changes happened, I could find work consistently with my food handling experience. </div>
          
          <div id="Q2">Why Tech? Why now?</div>
          <div id="A2">I've always loved technology and working with computers, but thought a career in tech would be impossible without getting a 4+ year degree. After I moved to the city, I discovered programming bootcamps which were much more approachable for my cook wages. I have reached a point in food service where I feel like the place to grow is to become a head chef in a kitchen. That's never something I've been able to picture myself doing.</div> 
          
          <div id="Q3">Why consider me?</div>
          <div id="A3">I have proven through my work history that I am PROFICIENT in organizing and team leading. I can solve problems on the fly. I know how to manage while building respect from my staff. I've never worked for a company I liked for less than 2 years. I love feeling like I am part of something bigger. My work history will show that I have advanced into management in every career that has had room to grow. I crave learning and improving. I am my most confident when I understand my product and my part in making it succeed.</div>
