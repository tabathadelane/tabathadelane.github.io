        <p>I am a bootcamp graduate from PDX Code Guild in Portland, Or. My background is in the service industry working with food and customers and managing teams. I love learning new things and working into a lead position where I can use my experience to teach others and help them grow. I started working at Subway out of high school and couldn't cook anything that didn't come out of a box with instructions. Now I feel comfortable following any recipe or multitasking an entire dinner spread. I've come such a long way, but I never saw myself running my own resturant. I have learned so much from this industry and will forever be grateful, but it is time for me to move on and apply my growth to another field. The skills I love using at work include problem solving, organization, time management, and collaborating. I enjoy being able to layout a plan so when things go off the rails (because they will somehow), it is easy to revaluate and get back on track. I am inspired by that feeling of overcoming obstacles with my teammates. </p>

        <p> I have always dreamed of working in tech, but I grew up in a rural part of the country where I didn't actually know anyone in that field. I assumed that to become a professional programmer you had to be a super math genius. I finally made it to city living and discovered coding bootcamps. This made continuing my education accessible! I worked hard for a couple of years and saved for the tuition, and now I am working harder to network in an effort to learn more about the industry. I am also doing my best to self teach on top of the foundation of technology I learned in the bootcamp. Trying to navigate that bootcamp limbo of finding the first job that will open up my future career has been daunting and discouraging, but it's only made me think more creatively about networking and  ways to improving my portfolio.</p>
