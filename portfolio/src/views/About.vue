        <hr>
        <div>I am a bootcamp graduate from PDX Code Guild in Portland, Or. My background is in the service industry working with food and customers. My favorite things about my past work has been training staff and learning new skills. I started working at Subway out of high school and couldn't cook anything that didn't come out of a box with instructions. Now I feel comfortable following any recipe or multitasking an entire dinner spread. I have learned a lot, but I never saw myself running my own resturant. The skills I loved using at work include problem solving, organization, and time management. I also loved that feeling of overcoming obstacles with my teammates. </div>
